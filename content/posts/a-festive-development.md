In the spirit of the season, why not add a little festive cheer to your apps with a little `Snowglobe` class that you can add to your view heirarchy!

The source code is available here [https://github.com/michaelsprindzuikate/Snowglobe](https://github.com/michaelsprindzuikate/Snowglobe), just provide your own snowflake image and enjoy the flurry of snow ☺️.


Merry Christmas, all.
