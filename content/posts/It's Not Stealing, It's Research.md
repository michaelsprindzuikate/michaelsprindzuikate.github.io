### Genesis
Back in the past, when I was first learning how to write software, there was always one thing accompanying me on my desk next to my CRT monitor, clacky-clacky keyboard and mouse with a little rubber ball inside. 
And it was a *book*.  
Not always the **same** book, but a book nonetheless.  

These books were my lifeline. They told me not just how things should work, but also how I should think. The coding styles applied in those pages defined how I should write code and what would be classed as "good".  

First of all, there's something about spending roughly Â£50 on something the thickness of a telephone directory that imbues it with a greater sense of worth and respect.  

If someone had gone through all of the effort to sit at their desk, write out twenty-five chapters on everything from `Hello World()` to accessing memory through pointers, get an editor to review it, publisher to agree to print it, get the thing printed, shipped to a shop and sold in a bookstore by a real person...well, the least I could do was to play my part and listen to what it had to say.

Along with the exorbitant costs associated with owning these weighty tomes, it meant that the range of my library was definitely lacking. I would own a few books on particular topics, my pool of resources limited to what I could afford and what looked like it was most applicable, from the few minutes of skimming pages in Waterstones. 
Therefore, when it came to looking for answers on C or C++ syntax, I turned to [Bjorn Stroustrup]! 
I would look to an O'Reilly, or a Sams for information on specific subjects and those individual books were the **only** truth to me. 

(Yes, I also owned a *...for dummies*, but won't say on what topic)

### A Brave New World
It's like when you're a child and all you know is what your dad tells you about the world. He has an answer for **everything**, and that's comfortable. But then you get a bit older and suddenly some of those things you were told start to contradict your dad, and that starts to feel wrong.

And so it was that the internet blossomed, suddenly what was unequivocal was up for discussion and those books I had referred to in order to build my own view of things became meek, and old.
Suddenly I didn't have to go to bed at 8pm anymore...

The internet gave rise to the spirit of open source, of sharing your own work with a wider community for both collaboration and criticism. Entire projects could be worked on by people who had never met in person and companies would rise and flourish on the back of utilising people's hard work that had been given to the universe. 

Hosted repositories such as GitHub and BitBucket became the library, with an infinite number of projects becoming the reference section. StackOverflow a place to ask, and what seemed incredible at the time, get *answers* to some of the most arbitrary and idiosyncratic questions imaginable. 
I'm getting a crash when launching an application on a specific chipset? Ah, that might be because this particular IRQ register needs to be set differently.
How could I post a request to a SOAP api using cURL? 
How to combine two strings together in Ruby?

Answers were now everywhere. 
And **mine**


### Charlotte's Web

More recently, I have been motivated to create a style guide for the development team to help keep our project consistent and aid with reviewing pull requests.  
Finding the right place to start and what constitutes a good guide can be hard to come by, especially when each organisation operates in their own very different way.
