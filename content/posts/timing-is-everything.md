# And I guess the question is "Why now?".

I've been loathe to start one of these things for a number of reasons and they normally fall into this order:

* What do I really have to say?
* Why would anyone care what I have to say?
* What if people don't like/care about what I have to say?
* Can I be bothered to go through the effort of making a website?

The answer to the first question is a very succinct "not a huge amount". But that's ok, I think. 

Questions two and three? Hey, let's see what we get. You don't know if you don't try.

And question four's answer is.... I very much cannot be bothered, hence why it's taken so long. I have finally stumbled upon a combination of GitHub Pages and Jekyll and spent a few hundred hours trying to find a theme that looks _kinda_ like what I'd like to read.

So without further ado....

**hello, world**
