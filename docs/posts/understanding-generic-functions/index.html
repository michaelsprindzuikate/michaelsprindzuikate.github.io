  "articleBody": "  Not sure you can get any more generic than this  One thing I’m often asked rhetorically by imaginary colleagues with the sole purpose of providing a blog post with context is\n Generics? They’re super complicated, aren’t they?\n And my answer is most definitely\n You bet!\nWell, kinda.\nWell, maybe.\nWell, not strictly, but I can see what you mean.\n One of the ways that it can be useful to understand and appreciate the value (some may even dare to say beauty) of generics is by taking a look at some of the built in generic functions in Swift and attempting to duplicate that same functionality ourselves.\nThis may seem daunting, but the principles we will adopt can be applied in many wider contexts in your own applications.\nMap Ah, Map! Good old Map! Friendly, simple, harmless old Mappy Mappy Map Map!\nThe map function is probably one of the first ones developers encounter when writing Swift code. It has the basic premises of “Turn this into that”.\nAnd how neatly it does it! If you are unfamiliar with what the map function looks like, it works like this\nlet items = [1,2,3,4,5] let output = items.map { \"\\($0)\" } print(output) // output is [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"] The map function takes one parameter, in this case a closure (basically a mini function) and applies that closure to each element in that collection. It finally returns a new collection containing the transformation of those items.\nIf we were to break this down into a numbered sequence, it would be:\n Take an element from the original array Turn it into a string Add it to a new array Repeat until original array is empty Return the new array  What this approach helps to demonstrate, is that there isn’t anything particularly magical going on with this function. Syntactically it can be strange, but it’s simply iterating over the collection, doing…“stuff”…and then popping out a new collection at the end.\nIn the above example, the syntax of $0 is just shorthand for “the object passed into this closure. There is a longer format for this which looks like\nlet output = items.map { currentItem in return \"\\(currentItem)\" } But functionally they are exactly the same and the use of either option is dependent on how simple or complex the code within your closure is and whether the extra clarity of naming the object is necessary.\nMy Map If we can understand the what of the map function, then we can replicate this and build our own version of Map.\nFirst, taking the “generic” out from the equation, we can focus on the what. If we were to write this as a more typical function, then it could look something like the below\nlet items = [1,2,3,4,5] func myMap(_ array:[Int]) - [String] { var output: [String] = [] for item in array { output.append(\"\\(item)\") } return output } // output is [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"] Generificationism To turn the above into a generic function, we have to think not about the content of the array, but the array itself.\nAs a collection, the array can contain elements of any type - strings, ints, bools, structs, etc.\nAnd as an object we can add functionality through extensions.\nLet’s iterate over the process of writing this in a generic way.\nFirstly, add an empty myMap function in an extension on Collection.\nWe can ignore any input parameters for the time being, but one thing we do know is that it will return an array. An array of what doesn’t matter right now.\nAdding that in the function signature but without specifying the Type, and taking the code above as an example, the structure of the extension starts to take shape.\nextension Collection { func myMap() - [] { var output: [] = [] // Do __something__ here return output } } Seeing all of these empty brackets everywhere is a bit confusing. How about we put a placeholder in for now to say that the array will be of some Type. Maybe an OutputType\nextension Collection { func myMap() - [OutputType] { var output: [OutputType] = [] // Do __something__ here return output } } We can see now that this can be called on any collection and will return an array of type “OutputType”.\nFunctionally, it creates an empty starting array, will do something in the middle and at the end return an array with stuff inside. How do we handle the something in the middle?\nNeeding Closure The something in this case is a closure. A closure is a piece of code, basically a self contained function, that is passed in as if it was a parameter. The calling function, in our case myMap(), can then execute this closure (function) when it needs to and return a result. In our non-generic function above, we wrote this\nfor item in array { output.append(\"\\(item)\") } Where (\"\\(item)\") turns the item, an Integer in this example, into a String.\nTo make things more generic, the specifics of the closure (function) aren’t important, only what the closure (function) wants to take in and what it will return.\nDefining a closure (function) that takes in no parameters, and return no result would look like this\n( () - Void ) To define a closure that takes in a String parameter, and returns a String result, would look like this\n( (String) - String ) To define a closure that takes in an Int parameter and returns a String result would look like this\n( (Int) - String ) So following this chain of thought, to define a closure that takes in a Generic Input Type would look like\n( (InputType) - (OutputType) ) Luckily for us, the Collection protocol defines an associatedtype called Element which acts like a placeholder type that can be used rather than defining our own.\nTransplanting this into our myMap function, it now looks something like this\nfunc myMap(_ transformation: ((Element) - OutputType)) - [OutputType] { var output:[OutputType] = [] // do _something_ here return output } Transformers in Disguise Finally onto the something in our function.\nThis bit is relatively simple compared to the rest. All we want to do is iterate over the collection, pass the current item into our closure and save the result.\nCalling a closure is done as you would a normal function call\nvar output:[OutputType] = [] for item in self { let transformedItem = transformation(item) output.append(transformedItem) } return output The Finished Article With all of these pieces put together we end up with a function that looks like the following\nfunc myMap(_ transformation: ((Element) - OutputType)) - [OutputType] { var output:[OutputType] = [] for item in self { let transformedItem = transformation(item) output.append(transformedItem) } return output } If you copy this into a Swift Playground and call it alongside the built-in version of Map, you should see exactly the same result.\nlet array = [1,2,3,4,5] let originalMap = array.map { \"\\($0)\" } let rewrittenMap = array.myMap { \"\\($0)\" } print(originalMap) //[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"] print(rewrittenMap) //[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"] Finally, if you Cmd+click on the built-in map function, you’ll see that the method definition looks very similar to ours!\npublic func map(_ transform: (Element) throws - T) rethrows - [T] The Foundation library version handles thrown errors, but other than that, what we ended up works in the exact same way.\nWrap Up Hopefully this helps to get a bit of a better insight to what a generic function is and how it can be incredibly powerful. The above will work for all object types, either built in or your own Structs/Classes, and without requiring any code changes to handle the specifics of those objects.\nWriting our own generic functions takes a slightly different approach to how we would normally write code, but it can give a flexible, clean and reusable set of tools to use alongside your more traditional techniques.\nOf course, the topic of Generics goes much deeper and further than this, with The Swift Programming Language eBook ( https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language ) providing a useful chapter on this subject.\nAs a further exercise, you could look into how to adapt this generic function to be able to map Dictionary objects. Perhaps I’ll write that as a follow up in the upcoming months.\n",

<h2 id="map">Map<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#map">#</a></h2>
<p>Ah, Map! Good old Map! Friendly, simple, harmless old Mappy Mappy Map Map!</p>
<p>The map function is probably one of the first ones developers encounter when writing Swift code.
It has the basic premises of &ldquo;Turn <em>this</em> into <em>that</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And how <strong>neatly</strong> it does it! If you are unfamiliar with what the map function looks like, it works like this</p>
<pre><code>let items = [1,2,3,4,5]
let output = items.map { &quot;\($0)&quot; }
print(output)
// output is [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]
</code></pre><p>The map function takes one parameter, in this case a closure (basically  a mini function) and applies that closure to <em>each element</em> in that collection.
It finally returns a <strong>new</strong> collection containing the <em>transformation</em> of those items.</p>
<p>If we were to break this down into a numbered sequence, it would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take an element from the original array</li>
<li>Turn it into a string</li>
<li>Add it to a new array</li>
<li>Repeat until original array is empty</li>
<li>Return the new array</li>
</ol>
<p>What this approach helps to demonstrate, is that there isn&rsquo;t anything particularly <em>magical</em> going on with this function.
Syntactically it can be strange, but it&rsquo;s simply iterating over the collection, doing&hellip;&ldquo;stuff&rdquo;&hellip;and then popping out a new collection at the end.</p>
<p>In the above example, the syntax of <code>$0</code> is just shorthand for &ldquo;the object passed into this closure. There is a longer format for this which looks like</p>
<pre><code>let output = items.map { currentItem in
	return &quot;\(currentItem)&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>But functionally they are exactly the same and the use of either option is dependent on how simple or complex the code within your closure is and whether the extra clarity of naming the object is necessary.</p>
<h2 id="my-map">My Map<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-map">#</a></h2>
<p>If we can understand the <em>what</em> of the map function, then we can replicate this and build our own version of Map.</p>
<p>First, taking the &ldquo;generic&rdquo; out from the equation, we can focus on the what. If we were to write this as a more typical function, then it could look something like the below</p>
<pre><code>let items = [1,2,3,4,5]
func myMap(_ array:[Int]) -&gt; [String] {
    
    var output: [String] = []
    
    for item in array {
        output.append(&quot;\(item)&quot;)
    }
    
    return output
}
// output is [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]
</code></pre><h2 id="generificationism">Generificationism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#generificationism">#</a></h2>
<p>To turn the above into a generic function, we have to think not about the content of the array, but the array itself.<br>
As a <em>collection</em>, the array can contain elements of any type - strings, ints, bools, structs, etc.<br>
And as an <em>object</em> we can add functionality through extensions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s iterate over the process of writing this in a generic way.</p>
<p>Firstly, add an empty <code>myMap</code> function in an extension on <strong>Collection</strong>.<br>
We can ignore any input parameters for the time being, but one thing we <em>do</em> know is that it will return an array. An array of <em>what</em> doesn&rsquo;t matter right now.<br>
Adding that in the function signature but without specifying the Type, and taking the code above as an example, the structure of the extension starts to take shape.</p>
<pre><code>extension Collection {
	func myMap() -&gt; [] {
		var output: [] = []
		
		// Do __something__ here
		
		return output
	}
}
</code></pre><p>Seeing all of these empty brackets everywhere is a bit confusing.
How about we put a placeholder in for now to say that the array will be of some <em>Type</em>. Maybe an <em>OutputType</em></p>
<pre><code>extension Collection {
	func myMap() -&gt; [OutputType] {
		var output: [OutputType] = []
		
		// Do __something__ here
		
		return output
	}
}
</code></pre><p>We can see now that this can be called on any collection and will return an array of type <em>&ldquo;OutputType&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Functionally, it creates an empty starting array, will do <em>something</em> in the middle and at the end return an array with stuff inside. How do we handle the <em>something</em> in the middle?</p>
<h2 id="needing-closure">Needing Closure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#needing-closure">#</a></h2>
<p>The <em>something</em> in this case is a closure. A closure is a piece of code, basically a self contained function, that is passed in as if it was a parameter.
The calling function, in our case <code>myMap()</code>, can then execute this closure (function) when it needs to and return a result.
In our non-generic function above, we wrote this</p>
<pre><code>for item in array {
	output.append(&quot;\(item)&quot;)
}
</code></pre><p>Where <code>(&quot;\(item)&quot;)</code> turns the item, an Integer in this example, into a String.</p>
<p>To make things more generic, the specifics of the closure (function) aren&rsquo;t important, only what the closure (function) wants to take <em>in</em> and what it will <em>return</em>.</p>
<p>Defining a closure (function) that takes in <strong>no</strong> parameters, and return <strong>no</strong> result would look like this</p>
<pre><code>( () -&gt; Void )
</code></pre><p>To define a closure that takes in a <strong>String</strong> parameter, and returns a <strong>String</strong> result, would look like this</p>
<pre><code>( (String) -&gt; String )
</code></pre><p>To define a closure that takes in an <strong>Int</strong> parameter and returns a <strong>String</strong> result would look like this</p>
<pre><code>( (Int) -&gt; String )
</code></pre><p>So following this chain of thought, to define a closure that takes in a Generic Input Type would look like</p>
<pre><code>( (InputType) -&gt; (OutputType) )
</code></pre><p>Luckily for us, the Collection protocol defines an <code>associatedtype</code> called <code>Element</code> which acts like a placeholder type that can be used rather than defining our own.</p>
<p>Transplanting this into our myMap function, it now looks something like this</p>
<pre><code>func myMap(_ transformation: ((Element) -&gt; OutputType)) -&gt; [OutputType] {

	var output:[OutputType] = []

	// do _something_ here

	return output
}
</code></pre><h2 id="transformers-in-disguise">Transformers in Disguise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#transformers-in-disguise">#</a></h2>
<p>Finally onto the <em>something</em> in our function.</p>
<p>This bit is relatively simple compared to the rest. All we want to do is iterate over the collection, pass the current item into our closure and save the result.</p>
<p>Calling a closure is done as you would a normal function call</p>
<pre><code>var output:[OutputType] = []

	for item in self {
		let transformedItem = transformation(item)
		output.append(transformedItem)
	}

return output
</code></pre><h2 id="the-finished-article">The Finished Article<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-finished-article">#</a></h2>
<p>With all of these pieces put together we end up with a function that looks like the following</p>
<pre><code>func myMap&lt;OutputType&gt;(_ transformation: ((Element) -&gt; OutputType)) -&gt; [OutputType] {

	var output:[OutputType] = []
	
		for item in self {
			let transformedItem = transformation(item)
			output.append(transformedItem)
		}
	
	return output
}
</code></pre><p>If you copy this into a Swift Playground and call it alongside the built-in version of Map, you should see exactly the same result.</p>
<pre><code>let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
let originalMap = array.map { &quot;\($0)&quot; }
let rewrittenMap = array.myMap { &quot;\($0)&quot; }
print(originalMap) //[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]
print(rewrittenMap) //[&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]
</code></pre><p>Finally, if you Cmd+click on the built-in map function, you&rsquo;ll see that the method definition looks very similar to ours!</p>
<pre><code>public func map&lt;T&gt;(_ transform: (Element) throws -&gt; T) rethrows -&gt; [T]
</code></pre><p>The Foundation library version handles thrown errors, but other than that, what we ended up works in the exact same way.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#wrap-up">#</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully this helps to get a bit of a better insight to what a generic function is and how it can be incredibly powerful.
The above will work for all object types, either built in or your own Structs/Classes, and without requiring <em>any</em> code changes to handle the specifics of those objects.</p>
<p>Writing our own generic functions takes a slightly different approach to how we would normally write code, but it can give a flexible, clean and reusable set of tools to use alongside your more traditional techniques.</p>
<p>Of course, the topic of Generics goes much deeper and further than this, with The <strong>Swift Programming Language eBook</strong> ( <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language">https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language</a> ) providing a useful chapter on this subject.</p>
<p>As a further exercise, you could look into how to adapt this generic function to be able to map <code>Dictionary</code> objects. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll write that as a follow up in the upcoming months.</p>
